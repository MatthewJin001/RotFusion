## A Practical Method For Hand-Eye Calibration Through Fusion

## Overview
Jin, G., Yu, X., Chen, Y., Zhang, L., Li, J. (2024), A Practical Method For Hand-Eye Calibration Through Fusion, submitted to IEEE/ASME Trans. Mech.

The hand-eye calibration problem is a fundamental problem in visual assisted robotics. Ensuring the calibration robustness is crucial as the calibration results are used in every task execution. Unlike traditional separate or simultaneous method, we propose a rotation fusion method to further improve the robustness. The proposed method is practical and includes four straightforward steps. First, the forward rotation estimate is obtained using the rotation of AX = XB. Second, the backward rotation estimate is achieved via the translation of AX = XB, which is not involved in existing methods. Third, the two rotation estimates are fused with identity covariance to cope with different noise conditions. Last, the translation estimate is obtained by a least-square minimization. Numerical simulations and real-world experiments are provided to validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed fusion method.

## How to use
### Dependencies
It works well on MATLAB R2023a. The GPA methods themselves are solver-free, while compared algorithms and evaluation need the solvers in Optimization Toolbox.

### Main Instructions
To run the GPAM calibration, call
```
[out] = Algo19_GPAM(bRie,btie,qij,pattern,patternX,patternY,K)
```
where
* ``bRie`` (3x3xn): the rotation matrix of robot pose from effector to base,
* ``btie`` (3xn): the translation vector of robot pose  from effector to base (unit: m),
* ``qij`` (2xnxm): the 2D pixel,
* ``pattern`` (3xm): the point position on the pattern, only used by GPAP,
* ``patternX`` (1x1): the pattern row, used to determine the center point for initialization,
* ``patternY`` (1x1): the pattern cloumn, used to determine the center point for initialization,
* ``K`` (3x3): the camera intrinsics,
* ``out``: the output structure, specifically includes the following
* ``eRc`` (3x3): the rotation matrix of hand-eye pose from camera to effector,
* ``etc`` (3x1): the translation vector of hand-eye pose from camera to effecotor (unit: m),
* ``p`` (3mx1): the feature point positons in the base frame, 
* ``rnti1`` (1x1):  the data preparation runtime (unit: seconds),
* ``rnti2`` (1×1)： the total runtime (unit: seconds).

### Demos
Demo ``main`` contains the calibration and evaluation of multiple methods. run ``main.m``, the results will be stored in ``result.xlsx``. The calibration and the evaluation results of the normal dataset in the paper are as follows
